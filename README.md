Machine Learning Hackathon Challenges
This repository contains solutions to three machine learning challenges developed as part of a hackathon. Each notebook addresses a real-world data science problem using supervised learning and model evaluation techniques.

üîç Project Overview
The goal of this project is to apply machine learning models to solve practical business and analytical problems, showcasing skills in data preprocessing, model training, and performance optimization. These challenges simulate real-world scenarios often encountered in data science competitions and industry tasks.

üìÅ Contents
Hackathon_Q1.ipynb: Predicting Credit Card Payment Default
Objective: Predict whether a client will default on their next credit card payment based on personal and financial data.
Importance: Helps financial institutions reduce risk by identifying high-risk customers.

Hackathon_Q2.ipynb: Estimating Taxi Trip Duration in New York City
Objective: Predict the total trip time of taxi rides given pickup and drop-off information.
Importance: Improves route planning and resource optimization for transportation services.

Hackathon_Q3.ipynb: Predicting Retail Store Sales
Objective: Forecast daily sales for a retail store using historical sales and promotional data.
Importance: Supports inventory management and marketing strategies by enabling accurate sales predictions.

üß∞ Tools & Technologies
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
pandas, numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib, seaborn
XGBoost, LightGBM (where applicable)

‚úÖ Why This Project Matters
These challenges demonstrate key competencies in machine learning for structured data problems. The models and techniques used can be directly applied in sectors such as finance, transportation, and retail to make informed, data-driven decisions.
